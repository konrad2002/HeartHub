# Design Guidelines (Web)

## Visual Direction
- Warm, tactile, and calm. Think soft paper, terracotta accents, and minimal chrome.
- Use a mix of soft gradients and glassy cards to create depth.

## Typography
- Primary: Space Grotesk (UI text)
- Accent: Fraunces (headlines)
- Headlines use the serif sparingly for emphasis.

## Color Palette
- Ink: #121212
- Slate: #5f6475
- Mist: #f5f2ea
- Cream: #fbf5e8
- Accent: #d96c3b
- Accent Soft: #f3c6a6
- Border: rgba(18, 18, 18, 0.08)

## Layout System
- App shell: sidebar + main content
- Content max width is fluid but keep cards in grids
- Use 24px base spacing increments for major gaps

## Components
- Cards: rounded, soft shadow, subtle border
- Buttons: pill shape, bold, with primary terracotta fill
- Badges: soft accent tint with small text

## Motion
- Use a single reveal animation on load (fade up)
- Avoid excessive hover effects

## Do / Do Not
- Do: keep surfaces bright and airy
- Do: prefer rounded corners over sharp edges
- Do: use serif for mood, sans for structure
- Do Not: use harsh black backgrounds or high-contrast neon
- Do Not: introduce new fonts without replacing both

## Naming
- Keep class names simple and semantic (e.g., card, badge, hero-card).
